**<font size="5">Morning Post News Site</font>** <br/>
This is a role based News app. <br/>
All users are allowed to view 6 articles on the home page and a list of all the articles available on the articles page.
<br/>
If a user would like to read an article, they will have to sign up for an account or login if they already have an account. <br/>
<br/>
Signing up for an account is easy, just enter a username and password and select the role you would like to have on the website.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose between 2 different roles, one being a generic Vanilla role and the other being an Editor. 
* Vanilla users will be able to read any article on the website as well as view any content a Guest can.
* Editor users can do everything a Vanilla and Guest user can but with the perk of being able to create, edit and delete their own         articles while on the website. 
* The Admin user can view all user's accounts on the website as well as what role the users have. If a article is created that is not appropriate for the site the admin can delete the user's post. If a user is using the site in an incorrect way, the admin has the power to ban a user's account.
