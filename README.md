You can choose between 2 different roles, one being a generic vanilla role and the other being an editor. 
* Vanilla users will be able to read any article on the website as well as view any content a guest can.
* Editor users can do everything a Vanilla and guest user can but with the perk of being able to create, edit and delete their own         articles while on the website. 
* The Admin user can view all user's accounts on the website as well as what role they have. If a article is created that is not appropriate for the site the admin can delete the user's post. If a user is using the site in an incorrect way, the admin has the power to ban a user's account.
