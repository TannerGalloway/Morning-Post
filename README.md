You can choose between 2 different roles, one being a generic vanilla role and the other being an editor. 
* Vanilla users will be able to read any article on the website as well as view any content a guest can.
* Editor users can do everything a Vanilla and guest user can but with the perk of being able to create, edit and delete their own         articles while on the website.
